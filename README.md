# `libconnect_n`

A small top-notch C++17 library that implements the algorithm
to check if a player's board state satisfies the requirements for winning the game.

### Bold claims

* It's deterministic.
* It's n-dimensional. (that's goal to expand the algorithm accordingly)
* It's well tested.

### TODO

* Expand check to test diagonals.
* Expand to n-dimensional boards.
